This repo contains data related sample code, written in 2017.

Sample codes use environment variables for secrets.

On Linux, you can set them in your ~/.bashrc file. 

Example: 

```bash
export PROJ_MYKEY="some value I want to set"
```

On Windows, you can set them in cmd box (Start, Run, cmd) then by issuing `SETX` commands. 
Values will be stored in the registry.

Example: 
```cmd
SETX PROJ_MYKEY "the value I want to set"
```
