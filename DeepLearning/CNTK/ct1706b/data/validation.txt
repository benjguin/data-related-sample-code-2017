Lorem ipsum.
The start of that mysterious phrase that seems to pop up all too often when you are laying out content in WordPress, or in Google Docs, any version of Microsoft Word after 2007, and even Joomla! The full version of it is:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
So what does it mean, and where did it come from?
The short answer you can give at cocktail parties: It’s randomly sampled text from one of Cicero’s published Latin treatises known as De Finibus Bonorum Et Malorum, the title of which translates “The Extremes of Good and Evil.” A slightly longer answer requires including the fact that some of the Latin text was “clipped” and curtailed mid-sentence, and re-assembled in an order that does not make sense. The original supposition as to why this was done pointed to the original “intended use” of the quasi-Latin text to mimic the letter frequency distribution of the English alphabet, if you can overlook the missing letters j, k, w, y and z, and disregard the fact that the letter “i” appears more often than “e.”
Before getting to the actual translation of the juxtaposed semi-Latin, there is a cascade of details telescoping retroactively from De Finibus Bonorum Et Malorum that is not well understood. It is actually a 5-book set of dialog among “friends” discussing the attributes of different philosophies throughout their “modus vivendi,” disagreeing with one another while respecting one another’s views. They debated, in turn, the benefits and detriments of Epicureanism (the notion that there are only atoms and voids, and that matter is the fundamental component in all of nature) Stoicism (the idea that harmful emotions precipitated from errors in judgment), and what we would call today the concept of being an “Academic.” Even in Cicero’s day back in 45 B.C., he would have referred to someone as an academic as being “Old School.” Cicero’s teacher, Antiochus, received his education from the distinguished line of philosophers at Plato’s Academy, but he disagreed with Philo of Larissa (the instructor at the time) on the concept of Academic Skepticism. Because Antiochus believed that the mind was fully capable of distinguishing that which is true from that which is false, essentially merging certain precepts of the Stoics and Peripatetics (literally, those who “walked around” the temple of Apollo Lyceus in Athens, where Aristotle “walked around” in contemplation of this philosophy) into Platoism, he founded what would subsequently be called Middle Platoism. This was more closely aligned to the ideals of what Cicero would have called the “Old Academy,” and, therefore, it is referred to as “Old School” in Cicero’s De Finibus Bonorum Et Malorum.
Antiochus eventually left to start his own academy in the ancient city of Ashkelon (today known as Ascalon), the largest sea port in Canaan, which is in present day Israel.
We can fast forward a bit now.
First, the world’s quickest Latin lesson. There’s no such word as “lorem” in Latin. There is, however, such a thing as “dolorem” and, furthermore, “dolorem ipsum” actually means “pain itself” and this does appear in Book 1 of Cicero’s De Finibus Bonorum Et Malorum.
So why “Lorem” and not “Dolorem” in the mysterious, ubiquitous phrase?
The answer can be traced back to 1914. There is a copy of De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum in the Loeb Classical Library where page 36 begins with “lorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, …” on line one. And, sure enough, on the previous Latin page (an English page was on the right, Latin on the left, throughout the entire book) we find “Neque porro quisquam est qui do-” hyphenated on the very last line. So now that we have a plausible source of the start of the mysterious text, and can construct the “real Latin,” we can start translating. But even “Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit” requires a little bit of backtracking to get the full context. That translates to “Nor again is there anyone who loves, pursues, or desires to experience pain itself, because it is pain.” That is actually a few sentences into a debate about pleasure and pain in the original text. So what were they saying?
“Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa, quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt, explicabo. nemo enim ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit, amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?”
…and further along we find another snippet...
“At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat”
“But I cannot explain to you all how this mistaken idea of criticizing pleasure and praising pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the method, and expound upon the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master builder of human happiness. Nobody rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves, pursues, or desires to experience pain itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?”
“On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through avoiding labor and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is unrestricted and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.”
But the phrase we commonly see is “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua” which we now know is “mid-phrase” and is missing the “v” from “velit,” and contains other insertions and ommissions.
And if we look at the entire, jumbled, pseudo-Latin text:
“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.”
…we could technically say it should truncate to:
“…loves, pursues, or desires to experience pain itself, because it is pain, but…circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great… To take a trivial example, which of us ever… laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who… find fault… who chooses to enjoy a pleasure…one…. avoids a pain… that produces no…blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee…blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying from avoiding labor….”
Of course, this is meaningless. But how did it make the leap from 1914 to the more contemporary age of today?
The first step back would have to be to the emergence of Desktop Publishing, a term all but forgotten today. In the 1980’s, it was a big deal, propelling Apple Computer with its Macintosh and Imagewriter (and later, the LaserWriter) into the forefront of the emerging market. MacPaint, MacWrite, FullPaint, and later, SuperPaint were the programs that gave even the novice a taste of what computer creativity could offer. Ashton-Tates’s FullWrite Professional was one of the earlier, costlier, and more robust page layout programs. Aldus Pagemaker superceded Fullwrite Professional, and here is where the trail begins.
In Pagemaker, whenever you launched a template, this is what you saw:

At the bottom-right, you can see the “Lorem ispum dolor sit amet…” text. It was present to allow the software user to see where text would “end up” if the rectangular boundaries surrounding it were to change. The use of foreign text would insure that the observant software patron would remove it by the time the document revision cycle was completed.
Well where did Aldus get the (presumably) canned text from?
Before the dawn of desktop publishing, there were large, pre-printed adhesive sheets with many different typefaces of all different sizes available from a company called Letraset. A page layout specialist would literally take out a large Letraset pad, and insert the letters into the desired location on a prototyping spread by rubbing the back end of the sheet until it transferred the image. Another way you could do this would be to cut out the letters using something sharp, like an X-acto knife, and place them carefully on a surface where they would stick. Any mishandling due to unsteady hands would result in scraping off the mistake and starting again.
Letraset had sheets of “Lorem ipsum,” which they, in turn, inherited from the metal sheet typesetters. So from where did the metal sheet fabricators get the idea?
You have to dig deep to find out the answer to this one. In a February 2001 online article, Cecil Adams goes back to a hard copy source dedicated to desktop publishing: “Before & After Magazine,” Volume 4, Number 2.
A Latin professor named Dr. Richard McClintock at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia was quoted in the article. He said:
“What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500’s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!”
So it appears that scholars of the 1500’s would instantly have recognized this text as nonsense, since they could easily read the Latin source, which was probably so well-known that the cannibalized text stuck out like a sore thumb.
And there you have it: perhaps the most comprehensive analysis of where Lorem ipsum solor sit amet comes from.
